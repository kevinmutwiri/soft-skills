3. **LEA**— Our _Q&A platform where technical mentors and peers will assist you with course-related queries_.

All these tools will be accessible via single sign-on through the [eHub](), giving you everything you need right at your fingertips!

## Savanna

**ALL course content** will be available here on **Savanna**. The course material is organized into **modules** with **projects**, similar to chapters, and new modules will be unlocked regularly, so you’ll always have fresh content to explore. 

You can check out the "**Projects**" section to see what you’ve completed and what’s still ahead. It’s best to go through the material in the order it’s presented!

## Device Guidelines

To truly thrive in this course, **having access to a reliable computer is essential**. A powerful desktop or a portable laptop with great battery life

While you will be able to check course content on your mobile device, relying on it alone will make things a lot trickier — especially when it comes to completing your Milestones and Tests.

Here’s why:

1. **Big Picture, Big Screen**: Working with Google Workspace—whether it’s documents, spreadsheets, or presentations—means dealing with a lot of information. A larger screen allows you to manage data more effectively and work more skillfully.
2. **Smooth Submissions**: Most Milestones require you to create documents, convert them to PDFs, and upload them to Savanna. Doing this on a phone can be a headache, and we can’t guarantee that your submissions will go through smoothly from a mobile device.
3. **Test Time Triumph**: The Professional Foundations Tests are designed for a seamless experience on a computer. Attempting to complete tests on a phone can lead to frustrating glitches, and even failed attempts.
4. **Interactive Learning**: Many of Savanna’s interactive features are optimized for computer use, so trying to engage with them on a mobile device might cause hiccups or incomplete content, making it easy to miss crucial information

> Your mobile device will come in handy when you need easier access to the course community channels on eHub.

> To succeed in tech, having a consistent and reliable internet connection is essential—and this course is no exception!

## Google Workspace

	
Google Workspace tools will be your playground. A Gmail account – which also serves as your Google Workspace account is a must - Gmail for personal use is free and allows you to access critical workspace tools, including _Drive_, _Sheets_, _Docs_, _Slides_, _Calendar_, _Google Meet_, etc.

step-by-step instructions here: [Create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en)

You will likely be using your Gmail to connect with potential employers through things like emails, file sharing, and online meetings, so think carefully about your username as it forms part of your email address (and personal brand to the outside world).

Use your name as your Gmail username. For example, if your name is `Sarati Jonas` then your username should be something like `Sarati.Jonas` or `sjonas`. If those usernames are taken Gmail will suggest suitable alternatives. Pick one that is professional.

**Why something professional**? Because your email will likely be the first impression you make when connecting with potential employers (or clients) via email. When thinking of it in this way, we’re sure you can see why using something like a nickname or pet name, e.g. `Sarababy`, `SJ4life`, or `BigMuscleS21`, will not demonstrate your professionalism. We encourage you to think ahead and pick a username that will create a great first impression of you in professional settings.
