## The Importance of Community

3 reasons we put such emphasis on community:

### Reason 1: To build a strong network beyond the course

By placing you in the Professional Foundations course community, we are inviting you to join our family of future leaders and we expect you to behave accordingly. The community is a space for you to get to know new people, engage with them, and learn from each other. We want this community to be an asset for you throughout your career.

### Reason 2: To empower you to take the lead in your career journey

The internet is turning the world into a small village. You no longer need to “cross oceans” to connect with like-minded people, or learn new skills and concepts. You can connect and learn from anyone in the world. We want to facilitate this transition, help you connect, and empower you on your journey.

### Reason 3: To help each other

There’s a saying we love here at all our partner organizations, which is: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Solo learning and solo online job searching are hard to maintain and can be intimidating. A proper support system makes all the difference. We want to create a place where community members can share resources, reach out for help, and provide feedback. The more you give, the more you get. We hope you will never feel alone with us.

### Process of Reporting Violations

If you are **subject to or witness a violation** of the **ALX Community’s code of conduct** on the **community platform**, please let us know by:

* Filling out this form: **[https://tech.alxafrica.com/report-offense](https://tech.alxafrica.com/report-offense)**. Make sure to include the following details:
* Link to the channel where the incident took place.
* Screenshots of the offending material.
* Visible name of the offender. This is critical to prove offensive behaviour.

If you notice a violation, you can also **reach out to message the involved parties privately** and **explain** why what they said or did might be hurtful to someone. We are a family, so feel free to be proactive and reach out privately before reporting.

## Community Channels on the eHub

Once you log into your eHub account, navigate to the Community tab right at the bottom of the page. You will find a series of community channels that you’re either already a part of, or can join by simply clicking the channel and then “**join space**”.

The most important for you to know about.

### Resources Channel

You will also be added to the `#Resources` channel automatically when you join the eHub. This channel is for you to access answers to course and tool-related FAQs, for example frequent questions about Savanna, the submission of milestones, and grading. We will also share important material needed during the course here, for example, links to reading resources, YouTube links to live sessions, and jobs if need be. This is a read-only channel, so you will not be able to engage or react to content here.
> Please make sure to regularly check the `#Resources` Channel for updates for the duration of the course.

### Squad channel

You will be part of a squad on the eHub. Your squad is your team (family) and this is where you can ask questions, discuss course content, or get help. You will be added directly to your squad once you get the invite link to join the eHub. Here are a few things to note about your squad channel:

- A squad channel is private and you cannot join other squads nor invite other participants to join your squad.
- Your squad channel will be the main channel you will use to engage with fellow participants and our team members.
- You will be able to post or share reactions on this channel.
- From time to time, our team will share prompts that will refer you to check the #resource channel.

> We might sometimes refer to the eHub as The Portal. They both mean the same thing, so anytime you see any of these variations, please know we are referring to your community platform.

**We’re sure that, by now, you are asking yourself why you were assigned to this squad and how relevant this is**.

To put it in simple terms: This is now your new family! They are the people who will be your first line of support, from discussing questions you have about what you are learning to getting help navigating the jobs that you are applying to. And who knows, they might become your lifelong friends—so make sure you take advantage of this opportunity to engage with them as often as possible!

People who did this in past cohorts were more likely to graduate and highly rated their overall course experience.

### Topic Exercise

Please do the following in your Squad right now:

Introduce yourself on your Squad channel by stating:
- Your name.
- What you love doing for fun.
- How you say hello in your home language.

If you are feeling friendly here are some things you might want to include:
- What inspires you.
- What you’re excited to learn.
- What other people should ask you for help with (it’s OK to flex a little bit and let them know where your strengths are).
- What you hope to achieve over the coming year.
- A person, a song, a quote, or anything that keeps you going even when times are hard.
- A photo that captures you or something interesting about you.

## Your Voice Amplified: The Power of ALX Hashtags

Throughout your ALX learning journey, you’ll encounter these hashtags:

- `#ALXLearnLoud`: Share your learning moments, insights, projects, and challenges. This hashtag builds your personal brand, demonstrates your expertise, and inspires others.
- `#LifeAtALX`: Capture your unique ALX experience, from everyday moments to major milestones. This hashtag connects you with the wider community, fosters a sense of belonging, and showcases the diverse paths to success within ALX.
- `#ALX`: Use this hashtag to connect all your ALX-related posts and activities. This helps to build a unified online presence for the community and increases the visibility of your work.
- `#DoHardThings`: Celebrate the challenges you overcome and inspire others to push their boundaries. This hashtag reflects the ALX spirit of resilience, determination, and growth.

By using these hashtags, you’re not just sharing your journey, but you’re also actively shaping the ALX community and amplifying its impact. Your voice matters. Use it to connect, inspire, and contribute to a movement that’s transforming Africa through technology.
