## Our Pledge

_We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation._

## CHAIR Values

To ensure that our community is functioning as it should be, we are governed by a set of values—CHAIR values. These are integral to us as an organization—our vision and mission.

These CHAIR values align with the Code of Conduct and the Honor Code.

### **Courage**

* I have the **boldness** to speak up, even against popular opinion.
* I **challenge** the status quo and ask, "How can this be done better?".
* I don't punish failure, but **celebrate learning**.
* I am **honest about my mistakes**, and admit them to others.

### **Humility**

* I **serve others** and my larger purpose.
* I know that I **constantly need to learn and grow**.
* I **ask for feedback** as an individual and organisation.
* I am **grateful** for both my **successes** and my **opportunities to grow and learn**.

### **Adventure**

* I am **not afraid to dream**, and I **boldly venture** where no one has ever been and set **wildly ambitious goals**.
* I believe it is **better to fail** while trying to achieve something **extraordinary**, than to **succeed** at something ordinary.
* I see life as a **joyous opportunity** to live.

### **Initiative**

* I do not ask for **permission**, but might ask for **forgiveness** later.
* I go the **extra mile** and **do what it takes** to achieve our goals.
* I **take ownership** of my work, and **don't wait** to be told what to do.
* **I get things done!**

### **Resilience**

* I tackle difficult situations with a **can-do attitude**.
* **I do not give up.** Ever. Even if it takes time and is hard.
* I see **challenges** as **opportunities**.
* I know I do not have it **all figured out**. But I give it my **best shot**. Again and again.


## Community Values

You are now part of one of the largest, most elite networks of young professionals on the continent. And we have expectations for how you behave in this special community.

Earlier on we shared an abridged version of community dos and don'ts when interacting on the eHub. Below is a more comprehensive list of the values and behaviors we expect from members of our community, both online and offline:

<img width="1176" height="653" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29c310ab-d02f-47da-912c-b60b13e21c14" />


## Code of Conduct

We want our community to provide a secure and inclusive environment for all participants, where they can learn and interact freely without experiencing any form of discrimination, harassment, or intellectual property violations.

In order to retain your access to the community platforms and City Hubs, you must agree to the Code of Conduct, which applies to all online and in-person community activities, and to all one-on-one communications with staff and your peers.

In short, the Code of Conduct requires you to:

- Practice CHAIR Values and Community Values to the best of your ability.
- Refrain from:
1. Harassment
2. Discrimination
3. Plagiarism
4. Cheating
5. Any other hurtful or unethical behavior
- Do everything you can to uphold privacy and protect data.

Please read through our official online and in-person guidelines below carefully.

### Online Community Guidelines

#### General Principles:

- **Plagiarism**: We take the integrity and authenticity of our learners’ work very seriously. Do not copy or plagiarize internet content, or the work of your classmates. For content submitted with data from the internet, always reference your sources, and ensure that your content is organic. Should you use AI to produce material, be sure to reference it.
- **Be aware of cultural differences**: Remember that members of the community may come from different cultures and backgrounds. Be respectful of these differences and avoid making assumptions or generalizations.
- **No spamming or self-promotion**: Do not post promotional content or spam messages. Posting relevant links or content is acceptable, as long as it is not excessive or aggressive.
- **Keep it legal**: Do not post any content that is illegal, promotes illegal activity, or violates any laws.
- **Digital inclusivity**: We believe that everyone has the right to a safe and respectful online environment, free from cyberbullying and other forms of digital abuse.
- **Use of AI for good**: As AI becomes increasingly present in our daily lives, commit to finding ways that can help you and your peers improve your workflow.

#### Dos:

• Update your profile on the eHub: Name (please be sure to use your name and surname), profile picture (please use a picture of yourself, not an avatar, a cartoon, or a symbol).

• Be nice and friendly to everyone, and report any inappropriate behavior. Respect the code of conduct when addressing others. Please check the purpose of the channel you are posting on. You will be asked to repost if you are on the wrong channel.

• Post content that is aligned with our community values and expected behavior.

• When communicating with AL staff, clearly state the message’s objective and what you need.

• Practice patience when requesting support from AL staff and your peers.

• Practice generosity and sharing your time and attention with the team.

#### Don’ts:

• Plagiarizing assignments or milestones, whether from the internet, peers, or past learners.

• Publishing private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.

• Perpetrate any public or private harassment, including but not limited to, posting or sending sexual content.

• Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

• Using channels as DMs—If you have to contact one person in particular, or if you want to send greetings, it is better to bring the conversation into a private space, using DMs.

• Impersonate another member (by using the same nickname and picture).

• Spam or troll other members.

• Post any links to copyrighted material.

• Post unrelated content to the purpose of the channel—Remember to check the channel description to know if your post would be pertinent.

• Share WhatsApp or Telegram group links.

• Ask for project reviews without an appropriate description (e.g. posting the link only).

• Share resources, or any type of links, without appropriate context.

• Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### In-person Community Guidelines

#### General Principles:

- **Respect other participants**: Treat others the way you want to be treated. Be respectful and courteous towards your fellow members, their work, and their space.
- **Keep it clean and tidy**: Clean up after yourself, keep your workspace clean and tidy, and leave communal spaces the way you found them.
- **Be mindful of noise levels**: Hubs can be noisy, but be aware of your surroundings and keep noise to a minimum when necessary.
- **Use common areas wisely**: Hubs have common areas that are meant to be shared by all members. Be mindful of others and don’t monopolize these spaces.
- **Follow the house rules**: Each Hub space has its own set of rules. Make sure you understand and follow these rules to maintain a peaceful and harmonious environment.
- **Don’t interrupt other members’ work**: Hubs are meant to be a productive environment. Be considerate of others and avoid interrupting their work unless absolutely necessary.
- **Respect confidentiality**: Many members of Hubs work on sensitive projects. Respect their privacy and keep confidential information private.
- **Be collaborative**: Hubs are meant to foster collaboration and creativity. Be open to working with others and sharing ideas.
- **Keep your workspace secure**: Keep your personal belongings secure and don’t leave valuable items unattended.
- **Have fun**: Hubs are meant to be enjoyable and inspiring places to work. Have fun and enjoy the community!

#### Dos:

• Attend community events on time.

• Meet and interact with your peers in a respectful manner.

• Being kind to others.

• Behave professionally.

• Respect the dress code (if specified for a certain event): In general, dress adequately for a work environment.

• Use welcoming and inclusive language.

• Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

• Allow the facilitators to moderate the conversation flow so that we can get through all the questions within the time allotted for discussion.

• In case of conflict, seek to resolve the situation respectfully and privately.

#### Don’ts:

• Perpetrate or threaten physical harm against other people.

• Perpetrate harassment, including but not limited to:

1. Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, [your specific concern here]).
2. Sexual language and imagery, including talks.
3. Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
4. Harassing photography or recording.
5. Inappropriate physical contact.
6. Unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention.
7. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

• Disrupt talks, events, or other activities.

• Use violent language directed against another person.

• Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors.

• **Sign-up for an event in a Hub and not attend**: In-person, blended, and live-streaming events will foresee a close number of participants, for logistical reasons. For this reason, if you are unsure whether you will be able to attend, please refrain from subscribing to the event, thus avoiding the risk of denying other participants the opportunity. If, for any reason, you are no longer able to attend, you will be able to unsubscribe from the event via Circle.

> Optional: If you are still curious to learn more, you are welcome to go and read further on the [eHub Terms and Conditions](https://www.alxafrica.com/terms-conditions-portal/).

### Harassment

**Harassment** is _behavior towards a person that causes mental or emotional suffering_, which includes repeated unwanted contact without a reasonable purpose, insults, threats, unwanted touching, or offensive language.

#### Types of harassment:

- **Verbal harassment**: Calling, or referring to, a person with intimidating, threatening, and/or diminishing language. Example: You call another student names, insult or make inappropriate comments to them or their loved ones, regardless of the reason.
- **Physical harassment**: Addressing a person in physically abusive ways. Example: You push, punch, or slap a fellow participant.
- **Power harassment**: Intimidating, threatening, and/or diminishing behavior coming from a person who takes advantage of their position against the victim. Example: A community manager or any university staff insults you, knowing that you are a student and will probably not take action.
- **Psychological harassment**: A mix of behaviors that makes the victim feel belittled, ashamed, or dismissed, and affects their mental health. Example: You bully a student in such a way that they don’t feel like coming to the City Hub anymore, or they stop engaging on the online community platform.
- **Cyberbullying**: Behaviors that happen on, or leverage, technology. Example: You share the personal info of a student with others, or you insult other students online.
- **Retaliation harassment**: A mix of behaviors aimed at taking revenge on the victim for something they have done. Example: You receive a review from a peer that you think is too low, and you take revenge on them.
- **Sexual harassment**: A mix of behaviors that imply sexual references. Sometimes it can take the form of a “tit for tat” type of exchange. Example: You make sexual comments to a fellow participant or university staff, and send sexual content. Or, you ask for sexual favors in exchange for the solution to a quiz or a good review.
- **Doxing**: Publishing or distributing someone’s private or personal information, such as their address, phone number, or workplace, without their consent.
- **Online grooming**: Building an emotional connection with someone over the internet for the purpose of exploitation, often leading to harassment, manipulation, or coercion.
- **Trolling**: Purposefully provoking or harassing others online by posting inflammatory or offensive content, often with the intent to disrupt discussions or incite negative reactions.
- **Stalking**: Engaging in persistent and unwanted attention or surveillance towards someone, often causing fear, anxiety, and invasion of privacy.
- **Invasion of privacy**: Violating someone’s personal boundaries—such as secretly recording or taking pictures of them—without consent, sharing private information, or spreading rumors about their personal life.

As more and more of our lives move online, online harassment has taken center stage in the conversation around this topic. In fact, this has been of special concern in academia. The impact of this online harassment extends beyond psychological harm, affecting victims’ work engagement and overall well-being.

### Discrimination

Discrimination is _treating someone unfairly based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or any other characteristic_. This includes verbal or written comments, actions, or behaviors that create a hostile or unwelcoming environment for others.

If you are not sure whether your behavior might be discriminatory, it is best to simply not do it.

### Plagiarism

Plagiarism is _presenting someone else’s work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement_.

Famous Examples of Plagiarism
- The ex-German Minister of Defence, Mr Karl-Theodor Zu Guttenberg, was accused of plagiarizing a big portion of his doctoral dissertation which, after a careful review, was proved to be equivalent to 63% of the entire content. He was removed from his position and lost his PhD title.
- A content editor from the New York Times, Jayson Blair, plagiarized content, and counterfeited photos and information intentionally, multiple times. The case caused real damage to the news agency’s reputation.
- Rudyard Kipling, the author of the famous children’s book The Jungle Book, admitted to having extensively plagiarized large parts of the story’s content, but didn’t remember from whose stories he had stolen.

### Cheating

Cheating is _obtaining, or attempting to obtain credit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by any dishonest or deceptive means_. This can include helping someone else to accomplish the same!
Cheating includes, but is not limited to:

- Plagiarism
- Lying
- Copying from another’s test
- Taking (or receiving) copies of solutions from someone else
- Using (or displaying) notes when it is not permitted
- Not following the stated guidelines for testing
- Using “cheat sheets”
- Getting information ahead of time that you are not supposed to have
- Allowing someone to do your work for you/pretend they are you

### Privacy and Data Protection

To help keep our community safe and thriving, we have policies to help ensure the security and confidentiality of our personal information in the digital world. Think of privacy as a personal boundary. It’s about having control over information about ourselves and who has access to it. Just like we wouldn’t want strangers peeking into our homes or invading our personal lives, privacy in the digital realm means protecting sensitive information, such as our names, addresses, contact details, financial data, and online activities.

How we maintain privacy and confidentiality in our community:

Practicing privacy and confidentiality within a community involves respecting and safeguarding the personal information shared by community members.

These are the ways we uphold privacy at our institute:

- **Obtain consent before sharing**: We seek permission from individuals before sharing their personal information, stories, or experiences with others. We obtain their clear, informed consent, and ensure they are comfortable with the extent of sharing. When in doubt, we don’t share their information.
- **Maintain confidentiality in discussions**: If the community engages in discussions or activities that involve personal information sharing, we emphasize the importance of confidentiality. We encourage all members to keep shared information to themselves, and refrain from sharing it outside the community without explicit permission.
- **Use secure communication channels**: We are cautious about sharing any financial or personal information. If we must share such details (for example to enable a payment to us), we make sure that the communication channel uses proper security protocols.

### Offense System

We are committed to creating safe, helpful, and friendly communities for everyone.

Most of the time, students conduct themselves ethically and within our Code of Conduct. But unfortunately, in some cases, we will need to make difficult decisions. Our System of Offenses oversees disciplinary actions, including temporary suspension or expulsion from the program and fellowship.

#### Offense Types

We place violations of the Code of Conduct into 3 categories.

#### The Consequences of a Breach

<img width="1173" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa7f331-1dca-42b7-a8c5-584a761cfde1" />

In summary:

- If a learner commits a misuse, they receive a soft warning.
- The first time a learner commits a mild offense, they receive a soft warning.
- The second time a learner commits a mild offense, they receive an official warning.
- If a learner commits 3 mild offenses OR 1 severe offense, then they will be temporarily banned from the program and required to complete a mini-course before being allowed re-entry.
- Any subsequent offense, after the completion of the mini-course, will result in expulsion (i.e. permanent ban from all university programs).

> Important! Any offense deemed severe enough can result in immediate expulsion.
