## Our Pledge

_We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation._

## CHAIR Values

To ensure that our community is functioning as it should be, we are governed by a set of values—CHAIR values. These are integral to us as an organization—our vision and mission.

These CHAIR values align with the Code of Conduct and the Honor Code.

### **Courage**

* I have the **boldness** to speak up, even against popular opinion.
* I **challenge** the status quo and ask, "How can this be done better?".
* I don't punish failure, but **celebrate learning**.
* I am **honest about my mistakes**, and admit them to others.

### **Humility**

* I **serve others** and my larger purpose.
* I know that I **constantly need to learn and grow**.
* I **ask for feedback** as an individual and organisation.
* I am **grateful** for both my **successes** and my **opportunities to grow and learn**.

### **Adventure**

* I am **not afraid to dream**, and I **boldly venture** where no one has ever been and set **wildly ambitious goals**.
* I believe it is **better to fail** while trying to achieve something **extraordinary**, than to **succeed** at something ordinary.
* I see life as a **joyous opportunity** to live.

### **Initiative**

* I do not ask for **permission**, but might ask for **forgiveness** later.
* I go the **extra mile** and **do what it takes** to achieve our goals.
* I **take ownership** of my work, and **don't wait** to be told what to do.
* **I get things done!**

### **Resilience**

* I tackle difficult situations with a **can-do attitude**.
* **I do not give up.** Ever. Even if it takes time and is hard.
* I see **challenges** as **opportunities**.
* I know I do not have it **all figured out**. But I give it my **best shot**. Again and again.
