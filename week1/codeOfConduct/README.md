## Our Pledge

_We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation._

## CHAIR Values

To ensure that our community is functioning as it should be, we are governed by a set of values—CHAIR values. These are integral to us as an organization—our vision and mission.

These CHAIR values align with the Code of Conduct and the Honor Code.

### **Courage**

* I have the **boldness** to speak up, even against popular opinion.
* I **challenge** the status quo and ask, "How can this be done better?".
* I don't punish failure, but **celebrate learning**.
* I am **honest about my mistakes**, and admit them to others.

### **Humility**

* I **serve others** and my larger purpose.
* I know that I **constantly need to learn and grow**.
* I **ask for feedback** as an individual and organisation.
* I am **grateful** for both my **successes** and my **opportunities to grow and learn**.

### **Adventure**

* I am **not afraid to dream**, and I **boldly venture** where no one has ever been and set **wildly ambitious goals**.
* I believe it is **better to fail** while trying to achieve something **extraordinary**, than to **succeed** at something ordinary.
* I see life as a **joyous opportunity** to live.

### **Initiative**

* I do not ask for **permission**, but might ask for **forgiveness** later.
* I go the **extra mile** and **do what it takes** to achieve our goals.
* I **take ownership** of my work, and **don't wait** to be told what to do.
* **I get things done!**

### **Resilience**

* I tackle difficult situations with a **can-do attitude**.
* **I do not give up.** Ever. Even if it takes time and is hard.
* I see **challenges** as **opportunities**.
* I know I do not have it **all figured out**. But I give it my **best shot**. Again and again.


## Community Values

You are now part of one of the largest, most elite networks of young professionals on the continent. And we have expectations for how you behave in this special community.

Earlier on we shared an abridged version of community dos and don'ts when interacting on the eHub. Below is a more comprehensive list of the values and behaviors we expect from members of our community, both online and offline:
