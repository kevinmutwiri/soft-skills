# Global Challenges and Global Opportunities

> [home](../README.md)

**Learning objective**: _Identify your personal mission in society_, as a young professional. 

In an ever-changing world of work, siloed academic learning is quickly losing relevance, unless it is coupled with a meaningful mission that enables you to meaningfully contribute towards the global narrative.

Watch [this video by Fred Swaniker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAN_r1K02uw) attentively, as he speaks on the importance of connecting your career to a meaningful mission (i.e. the so-called 7 Global (Grand) Challenges facing the world).

> Which problem do I want to solve? Then how do I get the skills and knowledge to solve the problem?
> Start with the problem you want to solve and then curate your knowledge around that problem.

1. Urbanization
2. Education - Reinvent education with the advent of AI and automation
3. Healthcare - healthcare models
4. Infrastructure
5. Youth Unemployment
6. Governance - just and equitable societies. Enable every human being live to their full potential
7. Climate Change

On the other side of the 7 Global (Grand) Challenges that Fred talks about, there are 7 Global (Grand) Opportunities. These are:

1. Agriculture
2. Natural Resources
3. Arts, Culture, and Design
4. Tourism
5. Women Empowerment
6. Regional Integration
7. Wildlife Conservation

**Reflect**:
At first glance, without overthinking about it:

- What Global Challenge resonates the most? Youth Unemployment
- What Global Opportunity resonates the most? Agriculture
- What seems to connect with areas you are passionate about? Education
- Is there a connection between any one of the GCGOs and a tech career? Yes there is. Youth Unemployment + Education
