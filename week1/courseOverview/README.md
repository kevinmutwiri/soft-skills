As Squad members, you will:

Unlike traditional courses, all learning content and assignments/milestones are designed to help you develop critical skills that you actually need for the real world of work.

- Weekly Tests help you assess whether you have understood the content.
- Milestones simulate projects done in the workplace, and provide you with actual work samples.
