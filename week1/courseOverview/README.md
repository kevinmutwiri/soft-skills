## What Makes The Professional Foundations Unique?

The Professional Foundations Course will equip you with **key tools**, and **critical soft and technical skills**. You will also invest your time in:

- Discovering who you are.
- Developing your character.
- Forming healthy lifestyle habits.
- Exploring rewarding ways to merge your professional aspirations and mission.

We will empower you to skillfully navigate and confidently lead the different aspects of your day-to-day.

This course will unlock your ability to build and practice additional critical real-world skills that are highly sought after by employers and clients.

As a Professional Foundations graduate, you will be:
- self-aware,
- aligned with your values,
- a great communicator and collaborator,
- humble and empathetic, and
- an analytical and creative thinker.

You will be well-equipped for your job search, as you will hold insider secrets for successfully finding and creating work opportunities and standing out in job interviews.

As part of this course, you will become a member of a community. Within that community, you will belong to a smaller group called a Squad, which consists of other peers who are also going through the course.

As Squad members, you will:

- Regularly communicate via eHub.
- Offer peer coaching sessions to one another.
- Support and motivate one another.

Out of the Squads, smaller teams are formed that collaborate on group projects (in-person or virtually). Many past participants report that the connections they made in their Squads and teams were what enabled them to complete the course successfully. These connections are often carried forward and form the foundation of the learner’s professional networks.

Unlike traditional courses, all learning content and assignments/milestones are designed to help you develop critical skills that you actually need for the real world of work.

- Weekly Tests help you assess whether you have understood the content.
- Milestones simulate projects done in the workplace, and provide you with actual work samples.

## Secret Sauce: The 8 Meta-Skills

The African Leadership Team conducted research that included interviewing over 200 executives across Africa and around the world to discover the answer to one key question.

> What skills are most important for entry-level employees to have when they work for your company?

What resulted from this was a list of 7 meta-skills that almost all employers agreed were essential to success for young people in today’s modern workplace. In addition to the 7 meta-skills above—due to the rapidly evolving employment and tech landscape—we added one more meta-skill on Tech Ecosystems.

## ehub

This will enable you to join the **Community** and your **Squad** (_your immediate community of peers_).

You are expected to:

- Keep track of announcements and updates that will be shared ever so often by the learning team on the platform.
- Participate in the activities/discussions within your Squad, or on the program-wide platforms.

### Community Engagements

With some of the weekly content, you will have the chance to take time out in which you can put our learnings into action. During these times, you will have the opportunity to:

- Apply your skills and knowledge.
- Connect and network with individuals and businesses in your community and on LinkedIn.

> At ALX and in this course, **70% of our learning is through doing**.

**Office hours** are scheduled to help you with content related to the week, as well as any questions that you might have.

**When**: Usually on Fridays at 2 PM GMT

**Where**: For details on how to join the office hours online, keep a lookout for communication from the learner experience team via email and through the `#Announcements` channel on eHub.

The course is _partially asynchronous_. This means that:

- Certain aspects of the course will happen at set times.
- Other elements of the course can take place within flexible time windows, at a pace determined by you.

Each week there is a:

- Large amount of new content to review and study.
- New Test and Milestone (these require an understanding and application of that week’s content).

> Important: Weekly Tests and Milestones due dates are always the same: **Mondays at 11:59 PM GMT**.

But, within a given week, you have the freedom and flexibility to decide when and how much you will review and study the content, when you will take the Test, and when you will work on and submit your Milestone (as long as it’s before the deadline). You can create your own schedule and work at your own pace.

The course requires you to complete **approximately 40 hours of work every week**.

You can expect to spend:

- `45%` → 18 hours per week going through engaging online content here on Savanna.
- `30%` → 12 hours per week working on activities, assessments, and reflections.
- `15%` → 6 hours per week collaborating with peers on community platforms and at the City Hubs.
- `10%` → 4 hours at least once weekly attending Live sessions and optional City events.

Each week, new learning material is released early on Monday morning. Again, in any given week, you have the flexibility to determine how you will schedule your time to complete the required work. But because there is so much content, it is important to manage your time wisely.

There will also be live and virtual events taking place over the duration of the course.

- Virtual events (such as office hours and expert sessions) will always be recorded and can be viewed after.
- Some of the optional live events will be hosted at the City Hubs.

For this reason we encourage you to take the time to find your closest City Hub and ensure you stay up to date with your City Hub’s calendar and list of beneficial activities.

In some weeks—particularly in Phase 2—group collaboration is required. You must coordinate with your assigned project teams to meet virtually (or in person if you all happen to live near one another).

YOU drive your own learning and determine your success. You will need to be intentional about managing your time to successfully complete the various requirements of this course.

To successfully complete this course, you must:
- Pass all Weekly Test with 70% and above
- Submit all Weekly Milestone on time
- Complete and pass all End of Module Quizzes
