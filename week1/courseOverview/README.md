You will be well-equipped for your job search, as you will hold insider secrets for successfully finding and creating work opportunities and standing out in job interviews.

As part of this course, you will become a member of a community. Within that community, you will belong to a smaller group called a Squad, which consists of other peers who are also going through the course.

As Squad members, you will:

- Regularly communicate via eHub.

Out of the Squads, smaller teams are formed that collaborate on group projects (in-person or virtually). Many past participants report that the connections they made in their Squads and teams were what enabled them to complete the course successfully. These connections are often carried forward and form the foundation of the learner’s professional networks.

Unlike traditional courses, all learning content and assignments/milestones are designed to help you develop critical skills that you actually need for the real world of work.
