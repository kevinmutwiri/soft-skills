## Welcome to PF

Immerse yourself in **8 Meta Skills**—essential principles and skills that will greatly influence your professional path. Mastering these skills will help you stand out in any environment you find yourself, whether in the workplace or while managing your own business.

## Why Complete the Professional Foundations Course?

A key driver and motivator that propels people to achieve the unachievable, set new norms, break limits successfully, and Do Hard Things is understanding **the WHY** behind their actions and/or goals.

### WHY Is Professional Foundations Required?

Employers from across the globe are consistently frustrated with entry-level employees because they often lack essential 21st-century skills. More specifically, they lack the ability to:

- Think critically and creatively to solve complex problems.
- Communicate fluently in both writing and speaking.
- Manage themselves and their time.
- Collaborate successfully with diverse team members to complete projects.

The Professional Foundations course is designed to give you a strong advantage by providing you with our **Special Sauce**– _a curated combination of meaningful opportunities to learn, practice, and deepen your knowledge, skill sets, and character qualities that are highly desired by employers, but that are not taught in most tech training programs._

Our Special Sauce consists of the **8 Meta Skills**. You can learn more about the WHY behind these meta-skills, as discussed in more depth in [this research article by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/defining-the-skills-citizens-will-need-in-the-future-world-of-work). In it, McKinsey shares what is truly needed to thrive in the ever-changing world of work. It will help you to realize just how important this course is for your future success!

## Course Structure 1

### The Content Release Cycle

The learning content for this course is divided into 12 weeks. The content is divided in such a way that it is sufficient for each week’s course load, so you should please pace yourself accordingly.
The content will be released every weeks, with one week worth of content released each time. So, for example, right now you’ve received the onboarding and Week 1 content. Content for Weeks 2 will be released in next week, when you’re completing the Week 1 content (the content you are busy with now).

### Office Hours

You will also have a weekly, live, hour long, online office hour session, where you will be able to join other learners as we:

- Provide an overview of the content for that week.
- Assist you with how to go about completing your assessments and what to look out for.
- Give you a space to ask questions, and learn from others questions.
The details for every week’s office hours will be shared with you via the eHub and your email

## Course Assessments

During the 12 weeks of this course, you will have 12 required Weekly Tests and 12 required Weekly Milestones due. Milestones are assignment submissions, which need to be submitted by uploading required documents here on Savanna. Tests, on the other hand, are auto-graded MCQs, which you will take here on Savanna as well.

This means that there is a total of 24 required elements that you must complete over the next 12 weeks of this course. All of the Tests will be auto graded. You will also have other items, such as End of Module Quizzes and Activities, that you must complete as you go through the course. All Milestones are required and will be marked as either ‘Pass = 100%’ if submitted or ‘Fail = 0%’ if not submitted.


> **Remember**! Each Milestone, and end of module checkpoint, helps you complete part of your next milestone assessment.

For this reason we strongly recommend:

- Putting the right amount of time and effort in to complete them, so that you’re not pressed for time at the end.
- Completing these assessments in the order that they appear on Savanna, as each assessment builds towards the next.

The following table shows the total contribution of each assessment type towards your grade:


| Assessment Type | Contribution to Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Tests | **50%** |
| Milestones | **35%** |
| End of Module Quizzes | **15%** |

---

Once again, as each milestone helps you prepare for the next one, it’s important to complete all of them to make sure you’re not leaving everything for the last minute. In what follows we provide you with the breakdowns of each assessment type:

- **The Weekly Test** is graded automatically and immediately on Savanna. As mentioned, you will have 12 of these throughout the course.
- **The Weekly Milestone** is a PDF submission. This will also be on Savanna. It is a required submission, and you will be marked either “pass = 100%” or “fail = 0%” based on whether you submit it. Submitting these milestones on time will give you score towards your overall course grade. Make sure you follow the instructions in each Milestone. Also ensure your submission follows the Milestone rubric provided.
- **Check Your Understanding Quizzes**: These are quizzes available at the end of certain modules. They are auto-graded here on Savanna. To successfully complete a quiz, you must answer all the questions correctly. You can retake the quizzes as many times as needed until you get all the answers right.

**To successfully complete this course, you must**:
- Pass all Weekly Test with 70% and above
- Submit all Weekly Milestone on time
- Complete and pass all End of Module Quizzes

### Submission Timelines

Now that you know what type of assessments are part of this course, let’s look at the submission timelines for each type of assessment, and how they are graded.

#### Weekly Tests

- These tests will be released with each week’s content, and need to be submitted by the deadline, which is Monday of the following week, by 11:59 pm GMT. For example, the Week 3 Test will go live with Week 3’s content, and will have a deadline of Monday 11:59 pm GMT in Week 4.
- Tests are automatically graded.
- You can re-take and resubmit these assessments as many times as you want to improve your score, as long as you do so before the deadline.
- Submitting the test, or re-taking the test another time, after the deadline will be considered late submission, and may result in a penalty and reduction in your score.
- All assignments will be closed for submission or re-takes at the end of the course.

#### Milestones

- These PDF submissions must also be made by the weekly deadline, which is Monday of next week, by 11:59 pm GMT. For example, Week 3 Assignment will go live with Week 3 content, and will have a deadline of Monday 11:59 pm GMT in Week 4.
- You can re-submit these assignments, if you want, as long as you do so within the deadline.
- Milestone submission is required, and you will receive grade towards your score for submitting these milestones on time.
- Submitting this type of assignment after the deadline, or re-submitting the assignment again after the deadline, will result in the assignment being considered late, and may result in a penalty and reduction in your score.
- All assignments will be closed for submission or re-takes at the end of the term.

#### End of Module Quizzes

- These MCQ checkpoints can be completed anytime during the week. Completing these checkpoints is required.
- You can re-take these MCQ checkpoints as many times as you want to improve your score.
- MCQs are automatically graded.
- You will be awarded a pass for these MCQ checkpoints when you get all the answers correct.
- Not all modules have an MCQ checkpoint at the end. In which case, you will only see a “Have you completed this module’s content?” yes/no question. You can mark this with a “yes” before moving on to the next module.
- Completing the MCQ checkpoints late after the end of the week, or missing them entirely, may result in a penalty and reduction in your score. So for example, you should complete all Week 2 checkpoints before the end of Week 2.
