## Why Complete the Professional Foundations Course?

A key driver and motivator that propels people to achieve the unachievable, set new norms, break limits successfully, and Do Hard Things is understanding **the WHY** behind their actions and/or goals.

### WHY Is Professional Foundations Required?

- Manage themselves and their time.
- Collaborate successfully with diverse team members to complete projects.

The Professional Foundations course is designed to give you a strong advantage by providing you with our **Special Sauce**– _a curated combination of meaningful opportunities to learn, practice, and deepen your knowledge, skill sets, and character qualities that are highly desired by employers, but that are not taught in most tech training programs._

During the earliest days of the African Leadership University (ALU), the African Leadership Team interviewed over 200 executives across Africa and around the world to discover their answer to one key question: _“What skills are most important for entry-level employees to have when they work for your company?”_

What resulted from this was a list of 7 meta-skills that almost all employers agreed were essential to success for young people in today’s modern workplace. In addition to the 7 meta-skills above—due to the rapidly evolving employment and tech landscape—we added one more meta skill on Tech Ecosystems.
