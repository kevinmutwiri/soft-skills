## Welcome to PF

Immerse yourself in **8 Meta Skills**—essential principles and skills that will greatly influence your professional path. Mastering these skills will help you stand out in any environment you find yourself, whether in the workplace or while managing your own business.

## Why Complete the Professional Foundations Course?

A key driver and motivator that propels people to achieve the unachievable, set new norms, break limits successfully, and Do Hard Things is understanding **the WHY** behind their actions and/or goals.

### WHY Is Professional Foundations Required?

Employers from across the globe are consistently frustrated with entry-level employees because they often lack essential 21st-century skills. More specifically, they lack the ability to:

- Think critically and creatively to solve complex problems.
- Communicate fluently in both writing and speaking.
- Manage themselves and their time.
- Collaborate successfully with diverse team members to complete projects.

The Professional Foundations course is designed to give you a strong advantage by providing you with our **Special Sauce**– _a curated combination of meaningful opportunities to learn, practice, and deepen your knowledge, skill sets, and character qualities that are highly desired by employers, but that are not taught in most tech training programs._

Our Special Sauce consists of the **8 Meta Skills**. You can learn more about the WHY behind these meta-skills, as discussed in more depth in [this research article by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/defining-the-skills-citizens-will-need-in-the-future-world-of-work). In it, McKinsey shares what is truly needed to thrive in the ever-changing world of work. It will help you to realize just how important this course is for your future success!

### The Content Release Cycle

The learning content for this course is divided into 12 weeks. The content is divided in such a way that it is sufficient for each week’s course load, so you should please pace yourself accordingly.
The content will be released every weeks, with one week worth of content released each time. So, for example, right now you’ve received the onboarding and Week 1 content. Content for Weeks 2 will be released in next week, when you’re completing the Week 1 content (the content you are busy with now).
