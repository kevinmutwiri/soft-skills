## Video Conferencing Etiquette and Tools

Participating in video calls via Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, Teams, and other video conferencing platforms means you will need to be on your professional “A” game.

### Dont's

1. Not having proper lighting
2. Distructions while on call like talking to someone else / picking a call
3. Noisy background
4. Joining the meeting on a phone especially when you need to do presentations
5. Distracting or unprofessional background
6. Talking while on mute
7. Not having the camera on or inappropriate camera angle
8. Unprofessional attire

### Do's

Turn on your camera in a well-lit room and ensure a good angle.

Find a quiet, distraction-free space to prepare for your call.

Use a computer or laptop, not a cellphone.

Avoid attending to matters outside the call. Rather excuse yourself if absolutely necessary.

Mute yourself when not speaking; unmute when it's your time to talk.

Make sure your background is appropriate and professional.

Avoid taking other calls during the meeting.

Dress suitably.
