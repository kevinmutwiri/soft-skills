## Morning Pages

**What are Morning Pages?**

Morning Pages were made famous more than 25 years ago in the best-selling book The Artist’s Way. But the practice is not just for artists! It’s a life-hack used by many successful business people, entrepreneurs, people who create social impact and, of course, tech talent! Doing morning pages every day has been shown to increase creativity, positive mood, and big-picture thinking for all kinds of people!


BUT, the purpose of Morning Pages is NOT to produce creative writing. Rather, writing Morning Pages provides you with the opportunity to clear out space in your head, so that your mind is more open to receive inspiration.

Here are the rules for how Morning Pages work:
- The ideal is to do them first thing when you wake up. But any time of day is OK.
- Get a pen and paper and just start writing (or keep a Morning Pages journal). You must do this by hand—don’t type!
- Write down whatever pops into your head. Really, whatever’s there—just write it!
- Don’t stop writing. Don’t re-read what you’ve written. Don’t go back and edit.
- If you don’t know what to write, then write, “I don’t know what to write. Maybe it’s because…” and you’re off again. Just keep the pen moving!
- Write 3 pages.
- When you’re done, put them in an envelope (or burn them). Don’t re-read them! Don’t share them with anyone!
> Remember, the point of Morning Pages is the process, not the product.

## Movement

**Much of our creative thinking is not even conscious!**
Insight and creative ideas are more likely to appear when we are not working hard to try and force something to happen. That is why carving out intentional time to be in your body and not think is such an important skill!

the benefits are not just limited to your physical health. Exercise improves your mood, productivity, and creativity as well.

The most important thing is not that you do exercise of any kind. You just need to move your body in some way every day, preferably for at least 20 minutes. Walking is just fine! Or pick any activity that you like! If you find it’s something you enjoy, you’ll be more likely to do it!
