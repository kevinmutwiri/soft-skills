To succeed in the ALX Professional Foundations Course, you need to:

**1. Embrace the Challenge** - This course will push you to grow and excel. Embrace each challenge as an opportunity to learn and improve.
**2. Stay Connected** - Leverage the connections. Collaborate with your peers, seek advice from mentors, and actively participate in the ALX community.
**3. Set Goals** - Set clear and ambitious goals for your ALX journey. Visualize your success and work steadily towards it.

> The most important thing to remember is that the small, every minute decisions and actions you make on your ALX journey are what will collect and build towards your success, not just at ALX, but also in life. **Step, by good step. Take good steps!**

To help us go far and have an unparalleled global impact, we have an amazing partnership with [the Mastercard Foundation](http://mastercardfdn.org/en/)
